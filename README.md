[View live project]()

This project, is a Gluten-Free recipe database where you can can enter your recipes on the home page, and they will show up on the appropriate pages, i.e Starters , Mains etc.
There is also the option to edit or delete these recipes.
I chose this project because a family member has celiac disease and has to maintian a gluten-free diet. 
This is my 2nd attempt at this project because my first project failed, and I had to start the project again due to the amount of errors I was getting which I never had previously

2. I want to view a list of gluten-free recipes that is healthy for me to eat.

3. I want to know the prepareations for each meal so I can allocate my time accordingly.

4. I want to be able to save my recipes so I can have quick access to all my favorites.

5. I want to view a complete list of ingredients so I  know what’s needed to prepare the dish.

6. I want to be able to remove ingredients from the list so I don’t double-up on items I may already
have.

7. I want to be able to add in notes to each dish so I can add my own thoughts, experiences or
things I want to remember about cooking the dish.

8. I want to be able to have my own personel profile where only I can add or delete items.

## Bugs
I had trouble getting psql to work , I kept having the error:
 psql: error: connection to server on socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432" failed: No such file or directory
        Is the server running locally and accepting connections on that socket?
And everything I tried did not work so I have decided to use MongoDB instead.
